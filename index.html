  <h5>About me!</h5>
  <p>Hello! My name is Krusty and I am a statistics fanatic. I graduated from CSULB with a B.S. in Statistics. Technically it's a B.S. in Math, Options in Statistics, but 'po-tate-o' 'po-ta-to'.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I am currently taking a Bootcamp in Data Analytics at UCI. It is pretty amazing so far, and I am excited to learn more about data analytics! I'm especially looking forward to the machine learning section. Should be challenging, but I always love a challenge. (:&lt;</p>
